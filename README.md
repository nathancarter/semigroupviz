# The Semigroup Visualization Package

## Purpose

This package adds visualization tools for semigroups.  It is built on the
JupyterViz package, which means that the visualizations it creates can be
used either in Jupyter notebooks or from the GAP REPL.

## Supported Visualizations

At present, there is but one supported visualization of a semigroup, the
egg-box diagram, defined as follows.

Let _S_ be a semigroup and make the following definitions, which introduce
[Green's Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_relations),
each of which is an equivalence relation on _S_.

 * Let _S_<sup>1</sup> be the corresponding monoid (_S_ plus an identity iff it doesn't have one).
 * Write _S_<sup>1</sup>_a_ for the principal left ideal generated by _a_.
 * For _a_ and _b_ in _S_, write _aLb_ iff _S_<sup>1</sup>_a_=_S_<sup>1</sup>_b_.
 * Similarly, _aS_<sup>1</sup> is a principal right ideal and _S_<sup>1</sup>_aS_<sup>1</sup> is a principal two-sided ideal.
 * And naturally also define _aRb_ for the right ideals and _aJb_ for two-sided ideals.
 * Define _aHb_ iff _aLb_ and _aRb_.
 * Define _aDb_ iff the _R_-class for _a_ and the _L_-class for _b_ intersect.

Thus Green's relations are the _L_, _R_, _J_, _D_, and _H_.  They give us the following situation:

 * _S_ is partitioned into _D_-classes.
 * Within each _D_-class, it is partitioned into both _L_-classes and _R_-classes.
 * One can think of each _L_-class as a column and each _R_-class as a row, forming a grid.
 * Each cell in the grid is an _H_-class, an intersection of an _L_-class and an _R_-class.

Hence the name "egg box" (or "egg carton") which is also a grid of cells.

For example, if _S_ is
[the semigroup of non-invertible transformations](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/semigroups-3.0.20/doc/chap8.html#X7894EE357D103806)
generated by the six idempotents of degree 3 and rank 2 (the details of which are not important here),
then its egg-box diagram looks like the following.

![Example egg-box diagram](doc/example-diagram.png =576x300)

It has the following properties.

 * There are two _D_-classes, the two large blocks.
 * The first _D_-class has 3 _R_-classes (its rows), 3 _L_-classes (its columns) and 9 _H_-classes (its cells).
 * Each _H_-class in the first _D_-class has two elements from the semigroup in it.
   (In this particular semigroup, elements can be represented as sequences of positive integers.)
 * The second _D_-class has 1 _R_-class, 3 _L_-classes, and 3 _H_-classes, each with one element.

This package produces diagrams like the one shown above (without the colorful explanations).
Since semigroups can be very large, it also permits you to show just a portion of the diagram,
and expand/contract certain portions as needed for inspection.

## Usage

The package does not need to be compiled.

There will eventually be a link here to the package manual.
