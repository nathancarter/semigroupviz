#! @Section Public API

#! @Arguments semigroup[, options]
#! @Returns nothing
#! @Description
#!  This function displays a visualization called an "egg-box diagram" of
#!  the given semigroup to the user by calling the display tools in the
#!  underlying <Package>JupyterViz</Package> package.  Egg-box diagrams
#!  are described in Chapter <Ref Chap="Chapter_eggbox"/>.
#!
#!  Using the <Package>JupyterViz</Package> package means that one
#!  of two methods will be used for showing the user the resulting
#!  visualization:
#!  <List>
#!    <Item>If this function is called in a Jupyter Notebook, it returns
#!      an object that, when rendered by that notebook, will result in
#!      the visualization appearing in the correct output cell.</Item>
#!    <Item>If run outside of a Jupyter Notebook, such as in the &GAP;
#!      REPL, this function creates an HTML page containing the given
#!      visualization and then opens the page in the system default web
#!      browser.</Item>
#!  </List>
#!
#!  It accepts the following arguments.
#!  <List>
#!    <Item>The first parameter must be a semigroup, as created by &GAP;'s
#!      <Package>Semigroups</Package> Package.</Item>
#!    <Item>The second argument is optional but if it is present, it
#!      should be a &GAP; record whose contents will
#!      govern how this function does its work, as indicated below.</Item>
#!  </List>
#!
#!  The fields you can provide in the <Code>options</Code> parameter are
#!  as follows.  Each is optional, and its default value is documented
#!  below.
#!  <List>
#!    <Item><Code>ToString</Code> can be a function mapping elements of
#!      the semigroup to strings, as documented in
#!      <Ref Func="SGPVIZ_HClassToRecord"/>.</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>NrDClassesIncluded</Code> can be the maximum number of
#!      D-classes to compute and include in the JSON object to be
#!      visualized.  This is useful if the semigroup is extremely large,
#!      and you want to send only a manageable amount of JSON data to
#!      be displayed, so that the computation becomes feasible.
#!      This defaults to 20.  Set it to 0 for no limit (if you know your
#!      semigroup is of a reasonable size).</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>NrRClassesIncludedPerDClass</Code> can be the maximum
#!      number of R-classes to compute for any one D-class and include
#!      in the JSON, for the same reasons as described above for
#!      <Code>NrDClassesIncluded</Code>.
#!      This defaults to 20.  Set it to 0 for no limit (if you know your
#!      semigroup's D-classes have a reasonable number of R-classes
#!      each).</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>NrLClassesIncludedPerRClass</Code> can be the maximum
#!      number of L-classes to compute for any one D/R-class and include
#!      in the JSON, for the same reasons as described above for
#!      <Code>NrDClassesIncluded</Code>.
#!      This defaults to 20.  Set it to 0 for no limit (if you know your
#!      semigroup's D-classes have a reasonable number of L-classes
#!      each).</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>NrElementsIncludedPerHClass</Code> can be the maximum
#!      number of elements to compute for any one H-class and include
#!      in the JSON, for the same reasons as described above for
#!      <Code>NrDClassesIncluded</Code>.
#!      This defaults to 20.  Set it to 0 for no limit (if you know your
#!      semigroup's H-classes have a reasonable number of elements
#!      each).</Item>

#! @Arguments semigroup[, options]
#! @Returns nothing by default but see <Code>ReturnJSON</Code> option below
#! @Description
#!  This function displays the Cayley graph of the given semigroup to the
#!  user by calling the display tools in the underlying
#!  <Package>JupyterViz</Package> package.  Cayley graphs
#!  are described in Chapter <Ref Chap="Chapter_cayley"/>.
#!
#!  Using the <Package>JupyterViz</Package> package means that one
#!  of two methods will be used for showing the user the resulting

#!    <Item>If this function is called in a Jupyter Notebook, it returns
#!      an object that, when rendered by that notebook, will result in
#!      the visualization appearing in the correct output cell.</Item>

#!      REPL, this function creates an HTML page containing the given
#!      visualization and then opens the page in the system default web
#!      browser.</Item>
#!  </List>
#!
#!  It accepts the following arguments.
#!  <List>
#!    <Item>The first parameter must be a semigroup, as created by &GAP;'s
#!      <Package>Semigroups</Package> Package.</Item>
#!    <Item>The second argument is optional but if it is present, it
#!      should be a &GAP; record whose contents will
#!      govern how this function does its work, as indicated below.</Item>
#!  </List>
#!
#!  The fields you can provide in the <Code>options</Code> parameter are
#!  as follows.  Each is optional, and its default value is documented
#!  below.
#!  <List>
#!    <Item><Code>ToString</Code> can be a function mapping elements of
#!      the semigroup to strings, as documented in
#!      <Ref Func="SGPVIZ_HClassToRecord"/>.</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>Generators</Code> can be a list of elements of the
#!      semigroup to use as generators (which are drawn as arrows in the
#!      Cayley graph).  If this is not provided, the function
#!      <Code>GeneratorsOfSemigroup</Code> is called to find a
#!      generating set and then a small subset of that is chosen,
#!      just enough to ensure the resulting graph is connected.</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>ShowElementNames</Code> may be a boolean, whether to
#!      show names of elements on the graph's vertices.  The default is
#!      true.</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>ShowActionNames</Code> may be a boolean, whether to
#!      show names of elements on the graph's edges, indicating which
#!      element's multiplication the edge represents.  The default is
#!      false.</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>Multiplication</Code> may be a string indicating
#!      whether the graph should show its action by left or right
#!      multiplication.  The default is <Code>"right"</Code>.</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>ReturnJSON</Code> may be a boolean and it defaults
#!      to false.  If set to true, then instead of calling the
#!      <Code>CreateVisualization</Code> function in the
#!      <Package>JupyterViz</Package> and returning its result,
#!      this function will return the &GAP; record that it would have
#!      passed to <Code>CreateVisualization</Code> for conversion into
#!      JSON and rendering.  Such data will be in a form amenable to
#!      rendering by Cytoscape, as documented in the
#!      <Package>JupyterViz</Package> package manual.  This option is
#!      useful if you wish to make some custom changes to that data
#!      before passing it to <Code>CreateVisualization</Code>, such
#!      as positioning the vertices in the plane or changing vertex
#!      or edge styles.</Item>

#! @Arguments semigroup, hclass, options
#! @Returns a &GAP; record obeying the options passed in the third argument
#! @Description
#!  This function converts the given H-class from the given semigroup
#!  into a &GAP; record amenable to conversion to JSON for passing to one
#!  of the HTML-based visualization tools from the
#!  <Package>JupyterViz</Package> package.
#!  Such conversion can be done by &GAP;'s <Package>JSON</Package> package.
#!
#!  <List>
#!    <Item>The first parameter must be a semigroup, as created by &GAP;'s
#!      <Package>Semigroups</Package> Package.</Item>
#!    <Item>The second argument must be a single H-class from that semigroup,
#!      which you can form in a number of ways, such as by choosing a
#!      D-class, lifting out its first R- and L-classes, and interesecting
#!      them.</Item>
#!    <Item>The final argument should be a &GAP; record whose contents will
#!      govern how this function does its work, as indicated below.</Item>
#!  </List>
#!
#!  Attributes in the resulting record include:
#!  <List>
#!    <Item><Code>size</Code> is the number of elements in the H-class</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>representative</Code> is a string representation of the
#!      H-class's representative.  The string representation will be computed
#!      by passing the H-class's representative element to the
#!      <Code>options.ToString</Code> function.</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>elements</Code> is an array of string representations of
#!      all the elements in the class, by default, or some subset of them
#!      if <Code>options.NrElementsIncludedPerHClass > 0</Code> and smaller
#!      than the number of elements in this particular class.  The
#!      representative is always first on this list.  These string
#!      representations are also computed by <Code>options.ToString</Code>.

#!  into a &GAP; record amenable to conversion to JSON for passing to one
#!  of the HTML-based visualization tools from the

#!    <Item>The first parameter must be a semigroup, as created by &GAP;'s
#!      <Package>Semigroups</Package> Package.</Item>
#!    <Item>The second argument must be a single D-class from that semigroup,

#!        <Item><Code>size</Code> is the number of L-classes in the R-class
#!          (though not all of these need be included in the return value;

#!          above, for details on its output format.
#!          (Not all H-classes need be included in the return value;
#!          you can set a smaller limit in

#! @Arguments semigroup, options
#! @Returns a &GAP; record obeying the options passed in the third argument
#! @Description
#!  This function converts the given semigroup into a &GAP; record
#!  amenable to conversion to JSON for passing to one of the HTML-based

#!
#!  Attributes in the resulting record include:

#!    <Item><Code>name</Code> is a string describing the semigroup.
#!      This will come directly from <Code>options.name</Code> if you

#! @Arguments hue, saturation, value
#! @Returns a &GAP; list containing three integers in the range

#! @Description
#!  This function converts a point in HSV color space into a point in RGB
#!  color space using the standard algorithm for doing so, available from
#!  many sources on the web.
#!
#!  <List>
#!    <Item><Code>hue</Code> should be a number in the range
#!      <Code>[0..360]</Code>, where 0 is the beginning of the color
#!      wheel (red) and 360 is the end (violet, becoming red again).</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>saturation</Code> should be a float in the range
#!      <Math>[0,1]</Math>, where 0 means no saturation of the chosen
#!      hue (white/gray/black only) and 1 means full saturation (a vibrant
#!      color from the chosen hue).</Item>
#!    <Item><Code>value</Code> (sometimes called brightness or lightness)
#!      should be a float in the range <Math>[0,1]</Math>, where 0 means
#!      a fully dark color (always black) and 1 means a fully bright
#!      color (the brightest color in RGB color space, subject to the
#!      constraints set by <Code>hue</Code> and <Code>saturation</Code>).

#! @Arguments semigroup, generators, options
#! @Returns a boolean indicating whether the given list of generators is
#!   sufficient to make a Cayley graph for the given semigroup connected
#! @Description
#!  This function defines a binary relation on the elements of the
#!  semigroup, meaning "there is a generator connecting these elements."
#!  It then asks &GAP; to compute the smallest equivalence relation
#!  containing that relation.  If that equivalence relation has just one
#!  equivalence class, the Cayley graph would be connected.

#!    <Item><Code>options</Code> should be the same options object
#!      passed to <Ref Func="ShowCayleyGraph"/>, because that function
#!      replaces the <Code>options.Multiplication</Code> option with

#! @Arguments semigroup, generators, options
#! @Returns a sublist of the given list of generators, one just large
#!   enough to ensure that the Cayley graph of the given semigroup is
#!   connected
#! @Description
#!  This function removes generators from the given list as long as
#!  doing so does not cause <Ref Func="SGPVIZ_GeneratorsAreSufficient"/>
#!  to return false.  When it cannot remove any more generators
#!  without violating that constraint, it returns the list it reached.
#!  This is done recursively.  Note that not all branches of the
#!  recursion are followed, for the sake of efficiency.
