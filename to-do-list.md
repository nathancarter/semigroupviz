# To-do list

## Cayley graphs

 * Add option for left-multiplication and document that.
 * Add option to return JSON form rather than render it, so the user can
   manipulate the cytoscape options however they choose; document this.

## Polishing

 * Write code for testing this package together with a master test script.
 * Show the package to Steve to see if it's what he was looking for.
    * In particular, is there any desire for a Cayley-graph-like
      visualization?  (Note the `Generators()` function in the
      semigroups package.)
 * Make any improvements he suggests.
 * Publish this to GitHub.
 * Ask Alex if we can include this in the next GAP release.
