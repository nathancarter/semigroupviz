# To-do list

 * Rename some of the functions with a prefix that indicates they are
   private to this package.  Update their documentation to indicate as much.
 * Create the other files necessary to create a manual.
 * Write code for testing this package together with a master test script.
 * Show the package to Steve to see if it's what he was looking for.
 * Make any improvements he suggests.
 * Publish this to GitHub.
 * Ask Alex if we can include this in the next GAP release.
