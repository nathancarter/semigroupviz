# To-do list

## Bug fixing

 * Re-capture the screenshot for page 8 of the manual, so that the
   text is the correct color, matching the link color in the other
   screenshots.

## Polishing

 * Create the other files necessary to create a manual.
 * Write code for testing this package together with a master test script.
 * Show the package to Steve to see if it's what he was looking for.
    * In particular, is there any desire for a Cayley-graph-like
      visualization?  (Note the `Generators()` function in the
      semigroups package.)
 * Make any improvements he suggests.
 * Publish this to GitHub.
 * Ask Alex if we can include this in the next GAP release.
