# To-do list

## Finalizing

 * Show the package to Steve to see if it's what he was looking for.
    * In particular, is there any desire for a Cayley-graph-like
      visualization?  (Note the `Generators()` function in the
      semigroups package.)
 * Make any improvements he suggests.
 * Ask Alex if we can include this in the next GAP release.
