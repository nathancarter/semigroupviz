  [33X[0;0YThis  package  adds  visualization  tools for semigroups. It is built on the
  [5XJupyterViz[105X  package,  which  means that the visualizations it creates can be
  used either in Jupyter notebooks or from the [5XGAP[105X REPL.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen   called   from   a   Jupyter   notebook  input  cell,  functions  like
  [2XShowEggBoxDiagram[102X  ([14X4.1-1[114X)  produce  a  visualization  in  the corresponding
  output cell. When called from the [5XGAP[105X REPL, the same function would show the
  same visualization by opening it in the user's default web browser.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  either  case,  such  visualizations support some level of interactivity,
  primarily  because  semigroups  can  be  very  large  and  thuse the user is
  permitted  to  select  the  subset  of  it  that  they  wish  to  see.  More
  documentation on this appears in Section [14X2.4[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAt  present,  there  is  only one visualization provided for semigroups, the
  egg-box  diagram,  which  is  documented  in  Chapter [14X2[114X. This package may be
  extended with other visualizations in the future.[133X
